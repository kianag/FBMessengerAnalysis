Enacted on 1/1/2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows consumers the right to any data collected by businesses on them. FB has information on every message I sent (along with reactions and images), every location I've ever logged in, every comment I made, every event I've been invited to, and so on.

I downloaded my FB data and analyzed my Messenger Data. Specifically I analyzed the top people I've messaged, my messaging patterns, and performed sentiment analysis on my messages.
